# Experimental data for the experiment result presented in Section 3.2 in the article

Here is part of the source text in Section 3.2:

> The particle concentration measures 10,000 particles/mL when the solution is diluted. A hologram is captured by the image sensor, and a region with a size of 1024×1024 in the whole hologram is cropped and selected as the test data (Fig. 3(a)). We crop this region to 4×4 sub-holograms with the size of 256×256 and backpropagate them to get 976 reconstructed images (1800-4800 μm, interval 50 μm, shape 256×256×976).

The **test_hologram.bmp** is the captured hologram in the experiment. The **cropped_hologram.bmp** is the cropped hologram used for the testing with the size of 1024×1024. And the 976 corresponding reconstructed images is inside the **test_in** folder. 

## test_in

The images with the same prefix belong to the same sub-hologram. For instance, "a1b1dis1800.bmp" and "a1b1dis1850.bmp" correspond to the same sub-hologram in the upper left corner. And the "dis1800" means that this image's reconstruction distance is 1800 μm.

Here is another part of the source text in Section 3.2:

> After that, we directly send (-0.3068, 0.2164, 0.8337) into Holo-processing as parameters and start to generate all the 256 groups of data processed by Holo-processing (1800-4800 μm, interval 200 μm, 12 particles per group). Then we get 4096 better synthetic images (shape 256×256×4096) as the training input images.

The synthetic training input data is inside the **train_in** folder and the corresponding synthetic training label is inside the **train_out** folder. <u>The data in the two folders can be generated by yourself using the "generate_simulation.mlapp" in the code folder, so the data is not included in the two folders now. If you need it, please feel free to reach out to the authors. We will be more than happy to assist with any reasonable requests.</u> 

## train_in

There are totally 4096 images with the size of 256×256 inside. Each image is named according to their property. For example, "re1_12Num_16Slice_at1800um.bmp" means that this image belongs to group 1, inside which are 12 particles distributed in 16 axial slice or layer, and this image's axial reconstruction distance is 1800 μm. The 4096 images consist of 256 groups, with 16 reconstruction images in each group.

## train_out

The images inside this folder are one-to-one to the images in the train_in folder. For instance, "pr1_12Num_16Slice_at1800um.bmp" corresponds to "re1_12Num_16Slice_at1800um.bmp" mentioned above.

## exp_pre

The predicted data in the test is inside this folder, inside which are 976 layer images with the shape of 256×256.

Here is the source text for the reference result:

> In order to examine the performance of the test result, we use the self-made compound focusing criterion (see Section 1D in **Supplement 1**) and manual examination to obtain the reference results, which are used to evaluate the results by the output of the simulator-trained model. These reference results are not the ground truth for the training of the U-Net, but for the evaluation of the prediction by the simulator-trained U-Net. When validating the network, these raw reconstructed experiment images are taken as the input. Through the simulator-trained U-Net and the output processing algorithm, the prediction results are generated and then evaluated by comparing to these reference results. 

## reference_result

The 16 sub-holograms' reference result are inside this folder. Load one result into MATLAB and you will get one variable named "output", inside which are three kinds of values, namely "lateral_position", "depth" and "diameter". Lateral position results are all in pixel units while depth results are in μm. Diameter results are in gray value. For example, 100 corresponds to 25 μm.

## training_log

It is the training log file. It corresponds to the result:

## recon_images_25μm

The 1936 reconstructed images are inside,  with the interval of 25μm. These are used for the generation of the reference result (see **compound_cri.m** in the **code** folder).

## binary_model

Our binary particle models are put inside this folder. When you try to run the **generate_simulation.mlapp** in the **code** folder to get synthetic data for the training, you will use these models.

## val_data

The data inside is used when you run the **train_Unet.py** program in the code folder. It is used as validation label.

## exp_model.h5

It is the trained model in the experiment. <u>It is not included now, but it can be obtained from the authors upon reasonable request.</u>
